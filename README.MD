# Selenium Account Checkers

Just scripts using Selenium to learn more about automation. 

Checks for valid accounts on a variety of services.

**WARNING:**

Checking too many accounts might result in a 'Too many tries' or similar error, and there will be a cool-down period where login for current IP will be disabled.

Includes simple scripts to split any combo list.
